# Rune Pool
Welcome to the Rune Pool project. The purpose of this project is to enable users to be able to collateralizise their rune non-fungibles on the open market. Users are able to request loans based on their rune non-fungibles with investors given the option of either investing in the general token pools or investing directly in loans that may be available. 

The concept is to make it easy for anyone to permissionlessly collateralize their non-fungibles and get closer to market debt positions as compared with more conventional lending modes.
